The problems with the original module supplied by NVIDIA:
  nvidia::ml
can be fixed very easily with the following:

1):
sed -i -e '/#undef bool/d' nvml_wrap.c

2):
fix the typecasts in lines 2041, 2046, 2051 of nvml_wrap.c

I have filed a bug report on this on 27-July-2021, at:

  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=138076


I have also included ways to fix it, including tips from:

   https://github.com/WGLab/PennCNV/issues/18#issuecomment-355322600

So, until NVIDIA applies these fixes (the module nvidia::ml has
been updated last on 2013) I feel I need to create a parallel module
  nvidia2::ml

as I need it and some modules I wrote need it.

If there is a legal or other problem please let me know ASAP and I
will consider it. I hereby declare that I do not claim any copyright
on the new module
  nvidia2::ml

All its copyrights are as originally were with NVIDIA.
